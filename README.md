# LessLib
LessLib is a library of useful mixins for the LESSCSS pre-processor. This pre-processor is a fantastic tool that extends CSS code by making it dynamic, thus making CSS code maintenance easier.

The mixins of this library are extremely easy to use and the idea is to make repetitive code less boring. The library is made up of mixins that I've usually been using in my web projects, so this list is sure to grow.
